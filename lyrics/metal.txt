Say your prayers, little one, don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in, warm within, keep you free from sin
'Til the Sandman, he comes


Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight


Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land


Something's wrong, shut the light, heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragons' fire
And of things that will bite, yeah


Sleep with one eye open

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Yeah-hah



Now, I lay me down to sleep (Now, I lay me down to sleep)
Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep)
If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake)
Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take)
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beasts under your bed
In your closet, in your head


Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land (Yeah, haha haha)

Oh, yeah-yeah, yo-oh
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
Take my hand
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land
We're off to never-never land

You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too
You'll fire your musket, but I'll run you through
So when you're waiting for the next attack
You'd better stand, there's no turning back
The bugle sounds, the charge begins
But on this battlefield, no one wins
The smell of acrid smoke and horse's breath
As I plunge on into certain death


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh


The horse, he sweats with fear, we break to run
The mighty roar of the Russian guns
And as we race towards the human wall
The screams of pain as my comrades fall
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
And the Russians fire another round
We get so near, yet so far away
We won't live to fight another day


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

We get so close, near enough to fight
When a Russian gets me in his sights
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow
A burst of rounds takes my horse below
And as I lay there, gazing at the sky
My body's numb and my throat is dry
And as I lay forgotten and alone
Without a tear, I draw my parting groan


Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh



Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time


All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify


Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah


I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal


And so, as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late
